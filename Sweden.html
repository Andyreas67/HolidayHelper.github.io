            <h3>Stockholm</h3>
            <p> Stockholm is the heart of Sweden. A vibrant city full of fun activities and stellar tourist attractions.Visit Gamla Stan(the Old Town), for the true Swedish experience. Its narrow winding roads and cobbled streets are filled with little cafés packed into beautiful ochre coloured buildings, seeing it in the early morning before crowds is a must.
                Want to feel the weight of Sweden's ancient and rich history? visit the <a href="https://www.vasamuseet.se/en">Vasa Museum</a>, home to a 17th century warship that spent 300 years beneath the waves.
                Let's be real, the reason you're here is for the swedish music, isn't it? Well look no further than the <a href="https://abbathemuseum.com/en/">Abba Museum.</a> A wonderful and interactive experience for all ages. Their new VR display allows you to sing along with the phenomenal foursome. For fans of a more modern music genre, the new <a href="https://tickets.aviciiexperience.com/en/to-do/2583686/avicii-experience/showdetails">AVICII Experience</a> in Space Stockholm is a must. This interactive exhibit chronicles Tim Berlings life and impact on music and allows you to play and mix his music in your own way.

            <h3>Lapland</h3>
                <p>
                    Bet you thought Lapland was in Finland ay? And you're right, it is. This is Swedish Lapland, it's basically the same but its Sweden. All the delights of regular Lapland apply here, a veritable winter wonderland full of picturesque scenes and awesome natural phenomena. This huge region covers a quarter of the elongated country, fully stretching into the Arctic. if you plan on visiting in the summer i suggest bringing blackout curtains as youll be exposed to the Midnight Sun, a natural occurrence in the arctic where the sun doesn't drop below the horizon for a number of weeks, providing ample time for activities and a weird, surreal experience for first timers to this weather condition.
                    If you would like a more traditional experience, then go in the winter months, when you can partake in husky sledding, ice fishing and of course looking out for the beautiful, magnificent and entrancing Northern Lights.Pack warm though as temperatures can range anywhere between -15 to -30 degrees Celsius.

            <h3>Sarek National Park</h3>
            <p>
                Want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city? Are you an avid outdoorsman? Then look no further than Sarek national Park. An absolutely gorgeous region filled with valleys, mountains and even glaciers to explore.
                Hiking is must if you're visiting, the Kings Trail is a popular route, but the Scandinavian Mountain range runs through the park if you want more of challenge.
                Camping is very popular in the area,and a must as there is no accommodation in the park itself. if preparing for a winter run through of the park please be mindful of quick and extreme changes in the weather.
                Follow river Deltas that cut huge swaths through the park, and bask in the unfiltered presence of nature.
